<h1>Group Project 1 proposal</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>

<p>The purpose of this project is to create an interactive visualization using
  real-world data. Using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and D3
  javascript visualizations, our objective is to create visualizations that
  confer the data in interesting, meaningful, and easy to understand ways.</p>

<h2>Data Description</h2>

<p>The data we are visualizing
  (located <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+Performance">here</a>)
  records data on student achievement in two Portuguese schools in the
  subjects of math and portuguese. The data we're most focusing on is which
  school the students go to (Binary: GP' - Gabriel Pereira or 'MS' -
  Mousinho da Silveira) in order to divide the data in more parts.  

 
<h2>Project goal</h2>
 
For this project, we would like to implement a bubble menu and a multi-bar bar
chart.
 
<p>        For the bubble menu, we would like there to be at least one bubble
  that represents some category of the data (i.e., “Time spent by students,”
  which can be further broken down into other bubbles, such as “free time,”
  “hours spent studying,” “hours spent traveling.” What we will then try to do
  is break each of these sub-bubbles into two more bubbles that represent the
  average numbers for each school. We could also include scaling for the
  bubble size depending upon how the numbers compare for each school.</p>
 
<p>        With respect to the multi-bar bar chart, we wanted to display
  multiple categories of the data simultaneously. Our idea was to split up
  rural and urban addresses and display free time, hours spent studying, and
  time to get to the school. Then we could determine the differences between
  the two and make some hypothesis as to how these differences arise.</p>
 
<h2>What we will learn</h2>

<p>      For this project, we’ll improve our proficiency with bar charts and
  understand the added challenges of working
 with multiple parts of a data set.</p>

<p> With respect to the bubble menu, that is a completely new design feature
  that we haven’t used, so that will be a totally new learning experience for
  both of us. Granted, for the bubble graph, there is a lot of starter code
  available, but we will make sure that anything we don’t understand initially
  is commented and ultimately understood. Furthermore, the example that we
  will be starting with for the bubble graph uses a JSON data source and
  doesn’t simply use a data source in the Javascript file, so we will have to
  understand that difference as well. It is unclear how difficult it is to add
  an arbitrary number of levels of bubbles to a bubble menu, so we will start
  with the bare minimum and try to add as much as we can depending upon how
  difficult it is.</p>
