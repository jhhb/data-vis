James's milestones / accomplishments + what needs to be done
---
Technically, everything on my end is done. Everything works and looks,
at a bare minimum, fine (or maybe even good? Some of it anyway, maybe).

I accomplished fully what I intended, i.e., making the stacked-to-grouped
bar chart representation for some dataset.

Something that needs work is styling. My styling (e.g. font labels) was not
that great and could be improved; after I finished the d3 stuff, I didn't
really want to mess very much with CSS, so my only improvement there
was making the school names bigger. I also made the headings / titles bigger,
but that was done in d3.js, not CSS.
