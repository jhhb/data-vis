James's milestones / accomplishments + what needs to be done
---
Technically, everything on my end is done. Everything works and looks,
at a bare minimum, fine (or maybe even good? Some of it anyway, maybe).

I accomplished fully what I intended, i.e., making the stacked-to-grouped
bar chart representation for some dataset.

Something that needs work is styling. My styling (e.g. font labels) was not
that great and could be improved; after I finished the d3 stuff, I didn't
really want to mess very much with CSS, so my only improvement there
was making the school names bigger. I also made the headings / titles bigger,
but that was done in d3.js, not CSS.

David's write-up
---
The shell is done, and I've put different types of data in it, but I'd like to
add new categories other than ages. It could be interesting to see absences
and grades among rural vs urban students, or among students with different
levels of family relations. There are many types of categorical information in this
set, so there are a variety of possibilities. In terms of the data itself, not
much of it is numerical. The only way to make it numerical would be to count
the students in each category, so most graphs would end up as number of
students and percentage of students, which isn't particularly
interesting. That's why I focus mostly on grades and absences.

I tried to make it so most functions could be applied to many different types
of data, which was helpful making the graph. The dual-scale bar graph is
complete, and the scales, titles, and labels are done. 

My styling is pretty awful. The colors of the bars need improvement -- red and
blue look neon, and green and purple look a little sickly. I could be more
descriptive labeling axes, but I'm not really sure what to add. I have not
added anything in CSS.
