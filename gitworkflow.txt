Hello,

The basic workflow for git is as follows:

---Cloning a new Repo---

1. create a directory on your computer called 'newDir'
2. cd into newDir
3. type 'git init' in newDir to initialize it as a git repository
4. type 'git clone' followed by the url to the repository

After this step, you will have the repository local

---Using the repository---

1. Before you make any changes to the repository, make sure to type 'git pull' to ensure that your repo is up
to date with your partner's

2. Assuming your repo is up to date, make any changes you want, including editing, deleting, or adding files

3. Once you are done, type 'git add --all'
4. type 'git commit -m "some log message for the commit goes here" ' to commit your changes
5. Type 'git push' to push to the master repository

6. Repeat 1-5 for the entire workflow.

Note: It is only fine for us to work this way because we are not editing the same files; otherwise branches would be
more important or necessary
